         <!-- What is Crossorigin? -->
        <!-- Crossorigin is an attribute that is used to specify how the browser should handle cross-origin requests.
        The crossorigin attribute can have three values: anonymous, use-credentials, and no-cors.
        The anonymous value is used to specify that the browser should not send any credentials (such as cookies or HTTP authentication) with the request.
        The use-credentials value is used to specify that the browser should send credentials with the request.
        The no-cors value is used to specify that the browser should not send any credentials with the request and should not allow the response to be accessed by JavaScript. -->

    <!-- Why there are 2 files why cannot they combine them to one file?
     ANSWER: React doesnot work only on browsers they work on mobile phones as well using React Native that is there are different places where react is used. 
     The first file is the core React code or library and the second file is the React DOM library which is used to modify the DOM. 
     React Native is used to create mobile applications using React. React Native uses the same core library but does not use the React DOM library. 
     The React DOM library is used to modify the DOM in web applications. The React Native library is used to modify the native components in mobile applications. -->
